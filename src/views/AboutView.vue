        <h3 class="title is-5">What is Den Defender?</h3>
        <p class="block">Den Defender is a free product created by 4FOX Security, aimed at helping individuals understand and improve their personal security online.</p>
        <h3 class="title is-5">How do I use it?</h3>
        <p class="block">You should see a list of questions on the left (if you are on a desktop) or at the top (if you are on a smaller screen). 
          When you answer questions, we'll build a list of recommendations for you which will appear either to the right or below. 
          We split these into immediate actions(which should take no more than 10-15 minutes), short term actions 
          (which might take an hour or so), and long term actions (which might require an entire evening or couple of days to complete).
           This should help you identify and tick off some 'quick wins', as well as have a complete picture of what we would recommend.</p>
        <h3 class="title is-5">Should I really be putting this information into a website?</h3>
        <p class="block">Great question! Ordinarily we'd say to be cautious about what you put online. This site, however, has been set up with 
          privacy in mind. We won't actually process any of the data you put into this website - it all happens on your end only. We designed
           it that way to ensure you can play around with the tool and have a complete list of our recommendations, without worrying about
           where we'll store it or what we do with it. Oh, and when you decide to refresh the page, the data will be deleted. Just make sure 
           nobody is snooping over your shoulder!
