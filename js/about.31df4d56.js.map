Ordinarily we'd say to be cautious about what you put online. This site, however, has been set up with \r\n          privacy in mind. We won't actually process any of the data you put into this website - it all happens on your end only. We designed\r\n           it that way to ensure you can play around with the tool and have a complete list of our recommendations, without worrying about\r\n           where we'll store it or what we do with it. Oh, and when you decide to refresh the page, the data will be deleted. Just make sure \r\n           nobody is snooping over your shoulder! \r\n        </p>\r\n      <h2 class=\"title is-4\">About 4FOX</h2>\r\n      <p>4FOX Security offer Information and Cyber Security Services and Expertise for small and medium sized businessess.
